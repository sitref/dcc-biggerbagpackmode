Hi,

And thank you for choosing SMX.

This is the BigBag version of SMX, which means it has a modified data file (assembly-csharp.dll) which in turn means it cannot be used with EAC enabled.

The standard UI design that BigBag ship with is the standard SMX frame.
Should you want to use the BigBag mod with another design you simply rename xui.xml into xui - smx.xml
Then copy/paste the design of your choice and rename the new copy file xui.xml.

When doing this correctly that will allow you to use the UI design of your choice within SMX and BigBag.

Enjoy!
